#I. WHAT IS THE BIG “PROBLEM” THAT YOU ARE SOLVING? WHERE IS THE PAIN?
We observed 3 great pain points in the industry:
1. The current methodology for virtual interaction and communication is not natural. When you discuss amazing ideas with your teammates and friends in the real world, you have a sense of dimensionality. For example, you hear the person sitting on your left from the left-perspective and same goes for other directions. Moreover, you may also decide to listen to some music and vibe with your team. This is the experience which brings life to a workspace environment. However, when you communicate virtually, this aspect of interaction is missing. A natural workspace like effect is the major component in getting that charm, curiosity, and efficiency back among people to work on breakthrough ideas.

2. There is no good way to search for teammates based on like-mindedness, background, tasks and missions you want to accomplish. These services exist for corporate work. What if you are searching for a teammate to go to a hackathon or for working on a small university-based side project?

3. Breaking the language barriers: The importance of even the smallest idea is really great. Sharing, and working on it with the correct person/teammate leads to breakthrough innovations! However, the only shortcoming is the language barrier. This leads to missing that opportunity that can significantly change the lives of millions or billions of people!

#II. HOW IS THIS PROBLEM CURRENTLY BEING DEALT WITH (IF AT ALL)?
The pain points are addressed at a shallow level and the methodology is not fully leveraged. The virtual communication sector is not as natural as it should be.

1. Multidimensional Audio manipulation is used widely in the gaming industry to make them interesting. We have several communication tools, however, none of them uses Multidimensional Audio manipulation to make the experience better. Getting the more natural way of virtual interaction (especially after the COVID pandemic) is NOT ANYMORE A DESIRE, it is a NEED.

2. Searching for people to hire for corporate industries have a lot of resources. However, think about high school and university students, or people who are not capable enough to pay their teammates. There are brains where breakthrough ideas nurture and have the potential to change the world. But is there a way they can get the resources they actually need? The ideas simply get directed to a lot of people in the community which may not be interested or have nothing to do with those concepts.

3. There are some technologies which are good tools to accomplish the goal to break the language barrier. However, we must implement those tools properly and more naturally to get the best experience for the people.
