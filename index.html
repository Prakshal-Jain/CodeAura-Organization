<div class="txtArea">
    <p>The pursuit of this idea started a month after the COVID pandemic strike US. All my friends went to their home country or different parts of US.
        I was initially working on a project with a small team of 3 people and we started to work virtually.
        I really missed that curiosity and charm whenever we used to meet in-person and discuss ideas (I think you can really relate to this), 
        which totally got blurred behind the screens of our computers and communication applications we were using.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, I decided to come up with the idea to enhance this experience with "CodeAura", with the mission to bring this experience closer to natural communication.
        We understand the importance of sharing thoughts and ideas effectively, and hence we work tirelessly towards making user experience THE BEST.
    </p>

        Come, join us on this mission!
